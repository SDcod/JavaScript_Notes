// Problem 2: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
// 📌 Problem Statement:
// Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another string by deleting some characters without changing their order.

// 🔹 Example:

// js
// Copy
// Edit
// Input: "abcde", "ace"
// Output: 3   // "ace" is the longest common subsequence
// 🔍 Why This Problem?
// ✅ Introduces dynamic programming concepts.
// ✅ Common in real-world applications like version control, bioinformatics, and text diff algorithms.
