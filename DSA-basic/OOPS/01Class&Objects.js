// ðŸ“Œ 5. Classes & Objects (Foundation of OOP)
// A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.

// âœ… Example: Creating Objects from a Class
// js
// Copy
// Edit
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 30);

person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
person2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob

// ðŸ”¥ Important Keywords & Concepts:
// class â†’ Defines a new class
// constructor â†’ Initializes object properties
// new â†’ Creates an instance of a class

// Classes: Classes are blueprints of an Object. A class can have many Objects because the class is a template while Objects are instances of the class or the concrete implementation.
// Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented languages there are no classes in JavaScript we have only Object. To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype-based Object Oriented Language, which means it doesnâ€™t have classes, rather it defines behaviors using a constructor function and then reuses it using the prototype.

// Note: Even the classes provided by ECMA2015 are objects.

// JavaScript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScriptâ€™s existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax is not introducing a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript. JavaScript classes provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance.
